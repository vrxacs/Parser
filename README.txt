This parser can handle +, -, *, and / as well as sqrt, sin, cos, and tan, and a variable x. The input file contains at least one expression, followed by a line with an integer for how many different values of x the expression should be evaluated at. This integer is followed by the appropriate number of values. The output is the average value of each expression for all provided values of x. For further examples, look at file.txt for sample input.
